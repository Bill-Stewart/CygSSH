NEWS for rsync 3.2.0 (UNRELEASED)
Protocol: 31 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.1.3:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Avoid a potential out-of-bounds read in daemon mode if argc can be made
      to become 0.

    - Fix the default list of skip-compress files for non-daemon transfers.

    - Fix xattr filter rules losing an 'x' attribute in a non-local transfer.

    - Avoid an error when a check for a potential fuzzy file happens to
      reference a directory.

    - Make the atomic-rsync helper script have a more consistent error-exit.

    - Make sure that a signal handler calls _exit() instead of exit().

    - Various zlib fixes, including security fixes for CVE-2016-9843,
      CVE-2016-9842, CVE-2016-9841, and CVE-2016-9840.

    - Fixed an issue with --remove-source-files not removing a source symlink
      when combined with --copy-links.

    - Fixed the block-size validation logic when dealing with older protocols.

    - Some rrsync fixes and enhancements to handle the latest options.

    - Fixed a crash in the --iconv code.

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Improved the --atimes patch and promoted it to be in the release.

    - Added --open-noatime option to open files using O_NOATIME.

    - Improved the --write-devices patch and promoted it to be in the release.

    - Added openssl support to the rsync-ssl script via its renamed helper
      script, rsync-ssl-rsh.  Install both bash scripts by default now
      (removing the install-ssl-client make target).  Rsync was also enhanced
      to set the RSYNC_PORT environment variable when running a daemon-over-rsh
      script. Its value is the user-specified port number (set via --port or an
      rsync:// URL) or 0 if the user didn't override the port.

    - Added a status output based on a signal (via both SIGINFO & SIGVTALRM).

    - Added a --copy-as=USER option to give some extra security to root-run
      rsync commands into/from untrusted directories (such as backups and
      restores).

    - When resuming the transfer of a file in the --partial-dir, rsync will now
      update that partial file in-place instead of creating yet another tmp
      file copy.  This requires both sender & receiver to be at least v3.2.0.

    - Added support for RSYNC_SHELL & RSYNC_NO_XFER_EXEC environment variables
      that affect the pre-xfer exec and post-xfer exec rsync daemon options.

    - Fixed a problem with the --link-dest|--copy-dest code when --xattrs was
      specified along with multiple alternate-destination directories (it could
      possibly choose a bad file match while trying to find a better xattr
      match).

    - Various manpage improvements.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Silenced some annoying warnings about major()|minor() due to the autoconf
      include-file check not being smart enough.

    - Improved some configure checks to work better with strict C99 compilers.

    - Some perl scripts were recoded into awk and python3.

    - Some code typos were fixed (as pointed out by a Fossies run).
