rsync
------------------------------------------

fast, versatile file synchronizing tool

Fast and versatile file-copying tool which can copy locally and
to/from a remote host. It offers many options to control its behavior,
and its remote-update protocol can minimize network traffic to make
transferring updates between machines fast and efficient. It is widely
used for backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for
everyday use.

   cygrunsrv --help
   cygrunsrv -I rsyncd -p /usr/bin/rsync -a "--daemon --no-detach"

*) remove service:
   cygrunsrv -R rsyncd
