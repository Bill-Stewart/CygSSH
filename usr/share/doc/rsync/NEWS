NEWS for rsync 3.1.2 (21 Dec 2015)
Protocol: 31 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.1.1:

  SECURITY FIXES:

    - Make sure that all transferred files use only path names from inside the
      transfer.  This makes it impossible for a malicious sender to try to make
      the receiver use an unsafe destination path for a transferred file, such
      as a just-sent symlink.

  BUG FIXES:

    - Change the checksum seed order in the per-block checksums.  This prevents
      someone from trying to create checksum blocks that match in sum but not
      content.
    - Fixed a with the per-dir filter files (using -FF) that could trigger an
      assert failure.
    - Only skip set_modtime() on a transferred file if the time is exactly
      right.
    - Don't create an empty backup dir for a transferred file that doesn't
      exist yet.
    - Fixed a bug where --link-dest and --xattrs could cause rsync to exit if
      a filename had a matching dir of the same name in the alt-dest area.
    - Allow more than 32 group IDs per user in the daemon's gid=LIST config.
    - Fix the logging of %b & %c via --log-file (daemon logging was already
      correct, as was --out-format='%b/%c').
    - Fix erroneous acceptance of --info=5 & --debug=5 (an empty flag name is
      not valid).

  ENHANCEMENTS:

    - Added "(DRY RUN)" info to the --debug=exit output line.
    - Use usleep() for our msleep() function if it is available.
    - Added a few extra long-option names to rrsync script, which will make
      BackupPC happier.
    - Made configure choose to use linux xattrs on netbsd (rather than not
      supporting xattrs).
    - Added -wo (write-only) option to rrsync support script.
    - Misc. manpage tweaks.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Fixed a bug with the Makefile's use of INSTALL_STRIP.
    - Improve a test in the suite that could get an erroneous timestamp error.
    - Tweaks for newer versions of git in the packaging tools.
    - Improved the m4 generation rules and some autoconf idioms.
