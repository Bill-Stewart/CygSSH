As mentioned in the README, many people have contributed to the code
making up libxcrypt, often under the aegis of a different project.  Of
the past contributors, we particularly wish to credit David Burren,
Ulrich Drepper, Alec Muffett, Colin Percival, Alexey Degtyarev, and
Thorsten Kukuk.

As well as the present maintainers, active contributors to the library
include Solar Designer, Dmitry V. Levin, and <vt at altlinux dot org>.

We would also like to extend our thanks in advance to everyone who
will, in the future, send us bug reports, suggestions, and contributions.

  -- The Authors.
